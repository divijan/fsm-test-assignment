AppRepository's several operations now depend on TransitionLog operations in an implicit way. Because
 of this we cannot, for example, use different DB backends for them. The
solution is to only leave the simplest building blocks of queries in these interfaces and push the
responsibility of assembling them into correct business actions to the controllers.
It's not clear whether it is a drawback that in this case for Slick that queries will have to be
combined on the level of Futures instead of DBIO actions
